## Starting the Application

1. **Copy the example environment variables file:**

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file according to your needs (e.g., database credentials).

2. **Make the startup script executable (if necessary):**

   ```sh
   chmod +x run-app.sh
   ```

3. **Start the application:**

   ```sh
   ./run-app.sh
   ```

Make sure you have created and configured the `.env` file before starting the application.
